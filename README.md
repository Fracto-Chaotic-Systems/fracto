# fracto

Main server for the Fracto mediaplex.

## Setup

The services under `servers/` are independent repositories. Check out each service and install its locked dependencies before starting Fracto. Startup does not clone repositories, copy data, or install packages. Before opening any port, it fetches every repository and applies fast-forward-only upstream updates. Tracked or staged changes, detached heads, missing upstreams, and divergent branches abort startup. Untracked runtime files are preserved.

```powershell
npm ci
npm run start:check
npm start
```

`npm run start:check` verifies all five service checkouts, entry points, ports, start scripts, and dependency directories without launching processes.

`npm run tiles:index` compiles the source JSON tile packets into a fingerprinted binary cache under `tiles/cache/indexed/`. Run it whenever the source manifest or packets change. `npm start` first updates the root and all five service repositories, then validates and loads that compiled cache while no HTTP server is listening. A missing or stale cache aborts startup with instructions to rebuild it. Use `npm run update:repos` to run only the repository-update phase. After the tile service becomes healthy, it starts the root server and remaining services sequentially, waiting for each health endpoint before continuing. Tile-index progress is shown in the console. The default health timeout is 300 seconds and can be changed with `FRACTO_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS`. Service output is appended to dated files under `logs/`.

Stop the root process with Ctrl+C to forward shutdown to every child service.

## Validation
